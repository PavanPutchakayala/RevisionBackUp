Discussing Problems faced with this kind of implementing POM - 
In earlier days people used this kind of Implementation

Question 1	: How do you Pass DRIVER(Initialised @ LoginTest), into EACH PAGE Class? Do u recommend this approach?
Question 2	: Issue: Passing of DRIVER OBJECT to EveryWhere(to PAGE CLASSES) - How to Overcome
Question 3	: Issue: Passing of OTHER OBJECTS (Ex: EXTENTREPORTS OBJECTS etc) to EveryWhere (to PAGE CLASSES) - How to Overcome



Scenario 1:	

	Step 1: Create package - pages & classes 
				1. LaunchPage.java
				2. HomePage.java
				3. EnterUserNamePage.java
				4. EnterPasswordPage.java
				
	Step 2: Create a Package - testcases & classes
				1. LoginTest.java
				
	Step 3: Lets see How the Problem is going to arise
				1. Create a method loginTest()
				2. Use the Annotation @Test
				3. Design code to Launch the Application*(Yahoo.com)
				4. INITIALIZE THE DRIVER
				5. Means u r LAUNCHING the Page - So
				6. Create an OBJECT of LAUNCH PAGE in loginTest() under - LOGINTEST.java
				7. Output of any page is REACHING u to another PAGE / portion of the same Page
				
				8. Under LAUNCHPAGE.java - create a METHOD navigateToHomePage() {} - which redirects to Next Page
